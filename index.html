  <p>W3C is developing web standards and guidelines for the purpose of establishment, and as a result of so far, it has published more than 80 W3C recommendations over the past 10 years. The W3C has also been involved in education and software development, and has held open forums to discuss the web. In order to unlock the full potential of the web, the most basic web technology is to be compatible with each other, and to be able to access the web from any software or hardware. This goal of W3C is called "Web Interoperability". The W3C aims to avoid market fragmentation and Web fragmentation by enacting open (anti-proprietary) standards for web languages and protocols.

  Tim Berners-Lee (Tim Berners-Lee) and the Officer is an industry consortium that has developed the W3C lead to consensus about Web technologies. Tim Berners-Lee, who developed the World Wide Web in 1989 while working for the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), has held the position of W3C Director since 1994, when W3C was founded. W3C held a symposium in Boston on the past and future of the Web and W3C in celebration of its 10th anniversary in December 2004.
